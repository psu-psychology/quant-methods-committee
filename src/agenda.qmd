# Agenda

This page summarizes some of the projects the committee *might* choose to work on.
The list is not exhaustive.

## Open science/open scholarship

- How do we consolidating existing open science/open scholarship expertise in the department and build upon it?
- How do we promoting these topics more widely in our research, teaching and training, including at the undergraduate level?
  - For example, what about "teaching replication" [@Frank2012-fc; @Chopik2018-wx]? See @Boyce2023-cx for some interesting results derived from a graduate methods course that specifically taught replication.

## Forging partnerships

- Should the committee seek to identify possible partners across the university and work to strengthen ties with them?

## Information gathering

- Do we need more or better information about quantitative methods use and needs in the department?

## Enhancing graduate teaching

- Are the needs outlined in the [Fall 2023 memo](pdf/quant-methods-committee-recs-2023-11-01.pdf) still relevant in Fall 2024?
- If successful, will the 2024-25 searches mitigate some of the needs?
- What else could or should be done?

## Curriculum assessment

- Should we work with faculty who teach *undergraduate* methods and statistics courses to support their work?
- Do we want or need to support new graduate coursework in the following topics:
  - Data management and sharing
  - Data visualization
  - Software development including version control
  - Research notebooks, e.g., [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org)
