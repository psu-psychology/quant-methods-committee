# Work

The committee has generated several work products in recent years.

## 2023 recommdendations

The [committee in 2023-24](index.qmd#2023-24-members) made [several recommendations](pdf/quant-methods-committee-recs-2023-11-01.pdf) to the faculty regarding how to bolster graduate teaching in quantitative methods.
The recommendations were based in part on a [survey](2023-fall-grad-survey.qmd) of courses taken graduate students in recent years.

## 2021 recommendations

The committee made a [presentation](https://psu-psychology.github.io/2021-11-18-fac-mtg-quant-meth/) to faculty in 2021 about quantitative methods and graduate teaching.

## 2017 grad student survey results

In 2017, the department surveyed graduate students about the quantitative and methods courses they had taken, and in what department, and what courses they hoped to take.
